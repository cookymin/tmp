# Demographic Explorer

This is a simple demographic explorer. Up above, in the `YAML` section of the document, you set a `state` variable. The code below creates a choropleth (i.e. color-coded) map that shows county-level population estimates for that state in 2013.

Note: the YAML portion of the document is not rendered when you click "Knit".

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# if you do not have the choroplethr and choroplethrMaps packages installed, 
# installed them with:
# install.packages(c("choroplethr", "choroplethrMaps"))
library(choroplethr)
library(choroplethrMaps)
library(stringr)

title = paste("2012 County-Level Population Estimates:", str_to_title(params$state))

data(df_pop_county)
county_choropleth(df_pop_county, 
                  title      = params$title, 
                  legend     = "Population", 
                  state_zoom = params$state)
```
